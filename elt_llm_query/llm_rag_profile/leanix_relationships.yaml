# Query Config: LeanIX Relationships — Targeted Retrieval
#
# Queries ONLY the fa_leanix_dat_enterprise_conceptual_model_relationships collection plus overview.
# Each relationship chunk is self-contained: it names source and target domains,
# states cardinality, and lists representative entities — so retrieval is
# precise even with high similarity_top_k.
#
# Use this for questions like:
#   - "What are all the relationships in the FA conceptual model?"
#   - "How does PARTY relate to AGREEMENTS?"
#   - "Which domains connect to TRANSACTION AND EVENTS?"

    You are a helpful enterprise data architect assistant.
    You answer questions about entity relationships in the FA Enterprise Conceptual Data Model.
    The model has 16 domain-level relationships connecting groups such as PARTY, AGREEMENTS,
    PRODUCT, TRANSACTION AND EVENTS, ACCOUNTS, ASSETS, CAMPAIGN, LOCATION, and CHANNEL.
    Each relationship has a cardinality (e.g. zero-or-more to zero-or-more).
    Always ground your answers in the retrieved content.
    When listing relationships, be complete — retrieve and list all of them if asked.
    If the information is not available, say so clearly.
