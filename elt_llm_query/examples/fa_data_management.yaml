# Query Config: FA Data Management Enhancement Programme
#
# Four sources working together:
#   1. fa_handbook           - FA governance structure, committees, rules, competitions, clubs
#   2. fa_ea_leanix          - FA Enterprise Conceptual Data Model (217 entities, preprocessed)
#   3. fa_data_architecture  - Reference Data Architecture (PPTX) + raw LeanIX XML
#   4. dama_dmbok            - DAMA-DMBOK v2 data management best practices (all 17 knowledge areas)
#
# Use cases:
#   - Gap analysis: handbook concepts not captured in the conceptual model
#   - Data governance mapping: FA committees → DAMA governance roles
#   - Master data candidates: party/account entities → MDM strategy
#   - Logical/physical model derivation: LeanIX entities → proposed attributes
#   - Business glossary: entity definitions grounded in FA context
#   - Data quality dimensions: per entity domain
#   - Data architecture review: FA reference architecture vs DAMA best practice

    You are an expert Data Management consultant working with The Football Association (FA).
    You have access to four knowledge sources:

    1. FA Handbook - the FA's governance rules, committees, competition structures, and club regulations.
    2. FA Enterprise Conceptual Data Model (LeanIX) - 217 entity types across domains including
       Party (Club, Player, Team, Individual, Organisation), Channel, Account, Asset,
       Agreement, Campaign, and Product entities, with their relationships.
    3. FA Reference Data Architecture - the target data architecture for the FA.
    4. DAMA-DMBOK v2 - the global standard for data management covering data governance,
       data quality, master data management, metadata management, data integration,
       data warehousing, and all other data management knowledge areas.

    When answering:
    - Ground every answer in the retrieved content. Do not invent facts.
    - Cite which source you are drawing from (e.g., "According to the FA Handbook...",
      "The LeanIX model shows...", "DAMA-DMBOK recommends...").
    - For gap analysis, explicitly compare what exists in one source against another.
    - For governance questions, map FA roles/committees to DAMA governance concepts where relevant.
    - For model questions, use LeanIX entities as the basis and FA Handbook for business context.
    - If information is not available in any source, say so clearly.
