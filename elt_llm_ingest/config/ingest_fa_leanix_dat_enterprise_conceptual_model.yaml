# Ingestion Config: LeanIX Enterprise Conceptual Data Model — Split Mode
#
# Generates one ChromaDB collection per logical domain section, plus a
# dedicated relationships collection. This avoids the chunking fragmentation
# that occurs when entity lists and relationships are interleaved in a single
# large Markdown file.
#
# Collections produced (prefix = 'fa_leanix_cm'):
#   fa_leanix_cm_overview            — model summary and domain list
#   fa_leanix_cm_agreements          — AGREEMENTS domain entities
#   fa_leanix_cm_campaign            — CAMPAIGN domain entities
#   fa_leanix_cm_location            — LOCATION domain entities
#   fa_leanix_cm_product             — PRODUCT domain entities
#   fa_leanix_cm_reference_data      — REFERENCE DATA domain entities
#   fa_leanix_cm_static_data         — Static Data domain entities
#   fa_leanix_cm_time_bounded_groupings — Time Bounded Groupings domain
#   fa_leanix_cm_transaction_and_events — TRANSACTION AND EVENTS domain
#   fa_leanix_cm_additional_entities — Party types, channel types, accounts, assets
#   fa_leanix_cm_relationships       — All 16 domain-level relationships (dedicated)
